<h2 align="center">OpenFeature Elixir SDKs</h2>

## 👋 Hey there! Thanks for checking out the OpenFeature Elixir SDKs

### What is OpenFeature?

[OpenFeature][openfeature-website] is an open standard that provides a vendor-agnostic, community-driven API for feature flagging that works with your favorite feature flag management tool.

### Why standardize feature flags?

Standardizing feature flags unifies tools and vendors behind a common interface which avoids vendor lock-in at the code level. Additionally, it offers a framework for building extensions and integrations and allows providers to focus on their unique value proposition.

## 🔧 Components
